Question: 	There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it
			will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. Your given two
			eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worse case.
Answer:
	Knowing that the building has 100 floors and we only have 2 eggs will
break at the same number floor attributing to worst case scenario we can start
at floor 50 and drop the egg. If the egg breaks then we know the floor we are
looking for is between 51 and 100. Knowing this we can skip every other floor
heading to floor 52...54...56 and so on. If the egg breaks then we know the
answer was the floor before. This means in worst case scenario 
1+(51-1)/2+1 or 1+(50-2)/2+1 which is roughly 26 steps for this solution

	Another way we can look at this is by dropping the first egg once
every ten floors, if it breaks on a particular floor then we know that it is
one of then ten floors before that from their we can drop the second egg every
other floor until it break. This means in worst case scenario 
10+(9-1)/2+1 or 10+(8-2)/2+1 which is roughly 14 steps for this solutions
