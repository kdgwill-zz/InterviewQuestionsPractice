Question:
	You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four-quarts of
water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of
the jug would be impossible.
			
Answer:
	We are given an advantage knowing that we have a five and three quart
jug. We know the average of five and three is four; as such we can simply fill 
the three-quart jug to the top and deposit the water into the five-quart jug.
Again fill the three-quart jug and deposit it into the five-quart jug until it
is full. This will leave one quart in the three-quart jug. Empty the five
quart jug and deposit the quart of water in the five-quart jug from the
three-quart jug. Finally fill the three quart jug one last time and empty it
into the five-quart jug, creating a five-quart jug with four quarts of water
in it.
