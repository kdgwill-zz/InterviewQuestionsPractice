Question:
	You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills
	of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how
	would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

Answer:
	Knowing that each regular pill in a bottle should weight exactly 1
gram and, assuming their are at least 20 pills per bottle, we can create
create some formula for deducing the bottle contributing the weight difference
in a single weighing. This unique formula will be a summation that can be
subtracted from the weighing and should indicate which bottle is different.
A simple formula would be a summation of multiples of pills to keep it simple
we can take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2, 3 pills from bottle 3
and so on an so forth. This would result in 1+2+...(n-2)+(n-1)+n or easily
condensed as n*(n+1)/2 which is a deduction from the average two formulas
(1+2+...)/count = (N+1)/2 and count = (N-1)+1. 
This results in (20+1)/2=210
We also know each pill should weigh 1 gram and one set of pills will weight
1.1 grams. Multiplying the sum of the pills by the expected weight will yield
the expected weighing result, so 1.0 gram * 210 pills is 210 grams expected.
We can subtract this weight from the scaled weight and divide it by the
positive valued difference between the heavier bottle and regular bottles
ie (scale-210)/(1.1-1.0) or simple (scale-210)/0.1
eg Assuming the scaled weight is 210.9
	(210.9-210)/0.1 = 9;
	Bottle number 9 contains pills weighing 1.1 pounds
