Question:
	There is an 8x8 chess baord in which two diagonally opposite corners have
	been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly 
	two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your
	answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

Answer:
	We know that an 8X8 chess board has 64 squares and two diagonal corners have
been removed. We also know that a single domino takes 2 squares meaning we
have (64-2)/2 or 31 positions; Normally this would work out pefectly however
the squares removed are not contigous and as such their will always
be an issue laying the very last domino
