Question: 	
	There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100
lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles
every third locker (closes it if its open or opens it if its closed). This process
continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith
locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100
how many lockers are open.


Answer: 
	We can first scale the answer to a smaller amount in order to grasp an
understanding. We will demonstrate using 10 Lockers. 
e.g. 0=open, 1=closed
0:0000000000 10:0
1:0101010101
2:0111000111
3:0110000011
4:0110100010
5:0110110010
6:0110111010
7:0110111110
8:0110111100
9:0110111101
From the example above it can be seen that 3 lockers are left open while 7 are
closed. Looking at the second row [row 1] we can see that at least half of
the lockers are open and the other half are closed. As the row increases the
amount of toggles per row also decreases, it can be deduced that this becomes
a factoring problem. this can easily be seen by looking at the former half of
the example above they have a smaller chance of being toggled and none after
half way. As such we can deduce that the only lockers that will be closed are
the evenly factored lockers this makes sense as locker 5 has exactly 2 factors
{1,5}, if the lockers are initially closed and opened on the first pass it
would be closed on the second pass. This however differs on locker 1,4 and 9,
which intrestingly enough has an odd amount of factors ie 1={1}, 4={1,2,4} and
9={1,3,9}. We can deduce that the odd factored lockers will remain open which
are considered perfect squares. This can be easy enough to find multiplying a
number by itself will produce a perfect square in the example above with 10
lockers 10 itself is not a perfect square but 9 is taking the square root of
that we find the number 3 which is the amount of lockers opened.

This also works in the larger example as 100 is a perfect square itself taking
its root shows that their are 10 odd factored numbers from 1-100 meaning 10
lockers will remain open.
