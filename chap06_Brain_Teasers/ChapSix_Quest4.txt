Question:	
	A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange
order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will 
be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's
eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them).
Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they 
do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed 
people to leave?

Answer:
	This can go one in three ways either all blue-eyed people will leave
in one day, the islanders will leave in N(the number of islanders) days or 
none will leave at all. 

The first scenario it is possible that the islanders 
will look around and either see a single blue-eyed person or non at all. Without 
a probable number they are left to assume that they themselves are blue-eyed and
eventually board the train this works if their are 30 blue eyed islanders or none. 

The second scenario is similar to the first however they are given the
knowledge that their is at least one blue eyed person on the island on the
first day their is still no probable way to determine if they are blue-eyed so
their is a possibility that at least one islander will leave everyday, coming
to the conclusion that they are themselves blue-eyed.

The third scenario is the exact opposite in which no islander leaves as none have 
probably reason to believe they are blue-eyed themselves and as such they stay on 
the island.
