Code Review Task

Code Review:
systematic examination (often as peer review) of computer source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the developers' skills.

The aim of this task is to examine a piece of code that your colleague has written. You must critically analyse and report on the quality of the code and review it for any mistakes, bugs or issues that you feel are present. You can make any comments, improvements or suggestions that you feel are appropriate about style, design and logic.

Please write any review comments inline in the code below in bold red text.

There is no word limit but try to not spend too long completing the task. Treat it as if it were a real review in your day as a developer.

This example is massively contrived and intentionally badly coded; don't expect code like this in your day to day life.
